# MSP430_Nios_I2C
This demo uses the Intel NiosII with I2C Host Controller to read data from the MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope.  The pdf file shows the accompanying NiosII system in Quartus that can be connected using arbitrary IO pins for SDA and SCL.
Some of the features of the Qsys NiosII are not necessary for this demo, they were for other demos.
